# string_reverse_keeping_the_special_charecter_at_same_position
It is a small code to reverse a string but it doesn't  normally reverse a string but it just reverses the alphabet sequence keeping the special charecter as it is. For ex: If Input String is: **"(!a)&amp;^bc"** then the resulting output will be **"(!c)&amp;^ba"**.
## USAGE
The software requirements include any c++ compiler such as devC++, codeblocks etc. Basic 2 libraries i.e the **iostream** library which is used to import some basic input and output streams. The second library is the **string.h** which is used to access the functions for the string i.e. lenght function.
