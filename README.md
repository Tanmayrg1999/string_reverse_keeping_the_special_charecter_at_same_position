# string_reverse_keeping_the_special_charecter_at_same_position
It is a small code to reverse a string but it doesn't  normally reverse a string but it just reverses the alphabet sequence keeping the special charecter as it is. For ex: If input Sting is: "*(!a)&amp;^bc" then the resulting output will be "*(!c)&amp;^ba"
